You have just dropped your device, and your heart stopped the very moment it dropped to the concrete floor. Yeah, does that sound similar? Many have dropped their beloved devices, and during the time it takes to fall from your hand to the ground, your heart stops a tad bit. Then you have the moment of truth, turning it over, hoping nothing bad happens to it. Most of the time you’re lucky, your handy dandy device is alright, but there’s also a chance that it the screen broke. But fear not, it’s not the end of the world. Yes, your device has a broken screen but chances it can be replaced quite easily. Going to a repair store might be a viable option but it’s not the only way to repair your device. It can be both costly. And you don’t know what kind of part their using on your phone. So what is the best way to go about this? Well back in the olden, everyone fixed everything themselves. That’s what I am going to be advocating for today, which is repairing your own device.
<br><br>
Yes, first it may seem like a daunting task, opening up your phone and then going into the unknown which the phone’s internal, but it doesn’t have to be. The internet has plenty of resource for repair related videos, and a search on YouTube can present many videos. In addition another amazing resource would be ifixit.com. They have an extensive resource on repairing every device in a step by step fashion.
<br><br>
Luckily, for repairing a device you need to be patient, you need have free time, and have a clear mindset and goal. In addition you need to keep your work space clean and organized. Usually some screws are different and if you put the wrong screw in the wrong place, the mother board can get damaged. You need to start by first identifying what the problem is, and if you were to drop your phone face down more than likely you have to change the screen of you phone. You can do research by searching up a video on YouTube of screen replacement of your device and or checking out iFixit’s teardown guides. And then you have to check out the price of the replacement part. You can check out the price either on AliExpress, Alibaba, and or eBay. There are different grades of replacement parts, OEM, refurbished, and grade AAA. Each part has their pro and cons to each. Refurbished are best suited for to get a close to original part, maybe the glass has been changed, but you’ll get close to original quality. OEM is basically the exact part that came from directly from the supplier, these are rare to find. And then lastly there will be the grade AAA quality displays which are completely aftermarket. These are usually affordable and the quality usually alright. 
<br><br>
To conclude, do your research adequately, keep your workspace organized, get the right parts, makes sure to balance quality to price. If you want to keep the device, then it is best to buy OEM or refurbished display.
<br><br>
Now to boost you guys confidence even further, as you have read the beginning and you can see it being relatable to a similar experience you may have. Unfortunately, well it did happen to me, well to my mother. The display on her phone was not functional, and I had change it. I offered to get her another phone, but she insisted on keep this one. SO the only option was to repair it, but if I were to do it in a shop it would be expensive. So I have decided to buy the part myself and then repair the device myself. I used iFixit’s guide and then utilized a couple of YouTube videos demonstrating how to change the display. Note, that this was my first time operating on any device, and I was nervous. I kept my workplace organized and then noted the different types of screws, and other notable features. And after 1 hour. 
<br><br>
I successfully changed my mother’s iPhone display. You need to be very careful because the flex cables are very fragile. After an hour, I was able to have a functional phone, and a new sense of pride for fixing a device what seemed hard. I was rewarded with a smile and appreciation that could last a long time.
